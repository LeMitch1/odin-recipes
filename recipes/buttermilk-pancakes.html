    <h3>Buttermilk pancakes drizzled with maple syrup</h3>
    <p>
        Buttermilk pancakes are an American classic breakfast food, but despite their unfussy ingredient list, too often people grab for the box mix because it’s just “easier”. Too many home bakers have struggled with dense, flat, or rubbery pancakes, or ones that have charred exteriors, raw centers, or are just all-around lacking in flavor. Today we’re going to fix that with my favorite, fool-proof buttermilk pancake recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, until well-combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together buttermilk,, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Take your melted butter and slowly drizzle it into your wet ingredients while whisking, stirring until well-combined (the butter may separate and curdle if your other ingredients are cold, this is OK, just whisk to combine). </li>
        <li>Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and use a wooden spoon to stir until just combined — do not overmix your pancake batter or your pancakes will be flat.  Use a light hand when stirring, and a few flour streaks in the batter are fine.</li>
        <li>Allow skillet to preheat before adding batter (about 5 minutes, it's good for your pancake batter to sit several minutes as well, which is why you prepared that before preheating your pan), and once skillet is heated (I usually test this by hovering my hand several inches above the pan and making sure I can feel the heat radiating from it) scoop pancake batter into pan (I use about ½-⅔ cup of batter per pancake).</li>
        <li>Allow pancake to cook until edges begin to appear cooked and bubbles in batter begin to burst.  Using a pancake spatula, carefully flip pancake and continue to cook several more minutes until pancake is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
